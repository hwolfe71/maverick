Maverick

	This is my poker hand evaulator. It's somewhat of a work in progress.
	Currently it deals out two five card hands and prints out the hands
	along with some debugging/lookup information.

Getting started:
	The java files need to go into a directory named Maverick, and the data
	in the data subdirectory.
